# topojson-viewer

A really simple viewer for topojson data - just drag and drop a topojson file into the marked area and it should show you the boundaries within. Available [here](https://uk-geodata.github.io/topojson-viewer/)

v 0.1 (2020-03-30) - absolutely dumb as a bunch of rocks, no error handling _at all_
v 0.2 (2020-03-31) - added properties viewer
